Repealing it could mean that more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose the critical protections they have now.

The Butch-Lewis Act in the American Rescue Plan allowed us to cover over 1,000 employers and 350,000 union workers and retirees facing benefit cuts of up to 60% starting in the next few years if we hadn't acted.
The American Rescue Plan helped keep multi-employer pension plans for union workers and retirees solvent for decades to come.   This week, we announced our plan to prevent drastic cuts to workers' hard-earned pension benefits that were scheduled to occur in the next few years.
By including the Butch-Lewis Act in the American Rescue Plan, we shored up the pension plans for millions of union workers. It represents the most significant investment in pension security for union workers and retirees in the past 50 years.

While Republicans have boldly stated that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare, Democrats will protect these programs.   The choice couldn't be clearer.

I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it.  Gas prices have dropped since mid-June and should continue to come down in the days and weeks ahead. I know those extra dollars and cents mean something.
With oil prices coming down 20% from June highs, it's unacceptable that prices at the pump have only come down by half as much.  It's time for oil and gas companies to pass these lower costs on to Americans.
Americans have seen gas prices drop by about 60 cents a gallon in the last month, saving the average driver about $30/month.  An extra 60 cents a gallon back in your pocket is meaningful. It's breathing room.   And we're not done working to lower costs for families.

When I took office, the economy had stalled and COVID was out of control. Since then, we've achieved the most robust recovery in modern history.   Because of that foundation, we're better positioned to overcome global inflation and reach a new chapter of stable and steady growth.
When I hear climate, I think jobs.   Good-paying, high-quality jobs that will help speed our transition to a green economy of the future and unleash sustainable growth.
Unions built the middle class. When you've got a union, workers' voices are heard and heeded. They provide democracy in the workplace and allow people to have dignity and respect in their work.

Less than 1% of the population risks everything to defend our nation, our values, and everything we hold dear.  Veterans are the backbone of who we are as a country.
This week, I signed nine different bills with overwhelming bipartisan support to improve care for our veterans and honor their service and sacrifice.   We must equip those that we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home.
Republicans talked about it, but we oversaw a deficit reduction of $350 billion last year—and we're on target to reduce the deficit by the end of the fiscal year by $1.7 trillion.
It costs drug companies $10 to develop a vial of insulin, but some families can pay as high as $1,000 a month for this lifesaving drug.  That's flat-out wrong—and it's why I'm fighting to cap the cost of insulin at $35/month.
While my economic agenda has put us in a better fiscal position—strengthening Social Security and Medicare—congressional Republicans have put forward a different approach.  Led by NRSC Chair Rick Scott, their plan would put these programs on the chopping block every five years.

In 1994, Congress passed a bipartisan assault weapons ban. Nine categories of semi-automatic weapons were included, like AK-47s and AR-15s.   In the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let the law expire in 2004, mass shootings tripled.
Here's what the overwhelming majority of American people believe we must do. https://t.co/u4MJuv6tCd
Over the last two decades, more school-aged children have died from guns than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined. Think about that.   How much more carnage are we willing to accept? How many more innocent lives must be taken before we say enough?

In Buffalo and Uvalde, I spent hours with family members whose lives will never be the same. They had one message for all of us:   Do something.  It's time for Congress to pass universal background checks and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

I grew up in a family where it mattered when the price of gas or groceries rose—that's why fighting inflation is my top economic priority.   By reducing health care costs, fixing supply chains, and making housing more affordable, we're creating an economy that works for everyone.

RT @POTUS : We need to:  Ban assault weapons — and if we can't, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.  Ban high-capacity magazines.  Strengthen background checks.  Enact safe storage laws and red flag laws.  Repeal gun manufacturers' immunity from liability.
RT @POTUS : This isn't about taking away anyone's rights.  It's about protecting children. It's about protecting families. It's about protecting communities.  It's about protecting our freedoms to go to school, to a grocery store, to go to church without being shot and killed.

The Ultra-MAGA Republicans' proposal puts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years.
I proposed a minimum tax for corporations that asks them to pay their fair share in taxes.   Senator Scott's plan lets them off scot-free."

Rebuilding America with union labor is smart for business.    Why? When union workers are on the job, projects are completed efficiently and professionally, and they ultimately save money.
Unions allow workers to maintain their dignity.   It's a lot more than just paychecks and benefits, it's about the dignity of workers.

When I took office, there were around 20 million people relying on unemployment benefits to feed their families; today, that number is around 1 million—the lowest since 1970.   We are building an economy that values the dignity of work.
There have been only 3 months in the last 50 years where the unemployment rate in America is lower than it is now.   This is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, our COVID vaccination program, and my plan to grow our economy from the bottom up and middle out.
The Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott of Florida would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average.  My plan would make it easier to start a small business by expanding their access to capital.

At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.
If the Court overturns Roe, it will fall on our nation's elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose.   And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.
I believe that a woman's right to choose is fundamental. Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.

There's a clear choice between a party that is focused on the future, and a party that's focused on trying to relitigate the past. If you're able, chip in to support electing Democrats who will help continue moving our nation forward. https://t.co/GqkAHx3GwO
RT @POTUS : I look forward to welcoming German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to the White House this afternoon. We're working together to support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and we're committed to making progress on COVID-19, climate change, and more.
When we invest in innovation, it powers up the private sector to do what it does best: creating new technologies, new industries, and most importantly new good-paying jobs. These are the kinds of partnerships that help us build a made in America future.   We can't slow down now.
Americans have missed more than 9 million cancer screenings in the last two years because of COVID-19.   If you were supposed to get a cancer screening during the pandemic, call your primary care doctor today.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our nation's roads and bridges, creating more good union jobs. And we'll do it by supporting union-based apprenticeships, community colleges, and on-the-job trainings in manufacturing and construction.
I know that there is more work to do to repair the frustration and fatigue in our country as a result of the pandemic, but we have come a long way in one year. Life-saving vaccines and an increase in our supply of tests are helping us get on track to moving beyond the pandemic.
From the largest drop in the unemployment rate on record to the largest reduction in childhood poverty ever recorded in a single year, my first year in office saw the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years.   There's more work to do, but America is on the move.
I know January was a hard month for many Americans. After almost two years, the emotional and physical weight of the pandemic has been incredibly difficult to bear for so many folks across the country.  But, despite the challenges, we have the tools to keep our recovery going. https://t.co/9pddR3Jr6z
Stronger law enforcement is critical to stopping gun crime, but it's made more effective when we invest in strengthening our communities.  My comprehensive strategy makes sure cities and states have the tools they need to invest in proven, community-based tactics to reduce crime.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law isn't just about infrastructure—it's about jobs.  We're going to create good-paying jobs for Americans by modernizing our bridges, highways, roads, ports, and airports.
I committed to this fight when I was Vice President. It's one of the reasons why, quite frankly, I ran for president. Let there be no doubt: Now that I am president, this is a presidential White House priority. Period. https://t.co/sXKyYt2Cz5
The hardships of the past two years are hard to overstate. But please know that our country and economy are in a much better place today. There is still more work to be done, but we are doing everything we can to prepare for a future beyond the pandemic.
In January our economy created 467,000 jobs, exceeding all expectations.   Over the last 12 months, our country added 6.6 million jobs—more than during any 12-month period in our nation's history.

Through the Build Back Better Framework, we're going to create an economy that works for working families, not just the few at the top.   And if you earn less than $400,000, you won't pay a single penny more in federal taxes. Period.
Let's get the Build Back Better framework done. https://t.co/x565C1wZQ3" The Build Back Better Framework will lower costs for working families without adding to the deficit. The Build Back Better Framework will deliver two years of free preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old in America and save most American families more than half of their spending on child care. "With the Build Back Better Framework, we will:  ? Deliver free, universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds ? Embark on an unprecedented effort to combat climate change ? Create millions of good-paying jobs ? Make health care more affordable for millions of Americans
The Build Back Better Framework will set the U.S. on course to meet our climate targets, create millions of good-paying jobs, and grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.  It's fully paid for by asking corporations and the wealthiest to reward work, not wealth.

An average of 600,000 new jobs have been created every month since we took office.   Jobs are up, wages are up, and unemployment is down. This progress is attributed to the hard work and resilience of the American people, who are battling through this pandemic.
Let's set one thing straight: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Agenda are not about left versus right.  They're about leading the world or continuing to let the world pass us by.
Before the American Rescue Plan passed, the Congressional Budget Office projected that it would take until 2023 to get to a 4.8% unemployment rate.  We hit that rate in October of 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made matters worse, creating a shadow pandemic for many women and girls who are largely confined to their home with their abuser and facing economic insecurity that makes escape more difficult.
As many as 1 in 3 women is the victim of gender-based violence at some point in her life, and that rate is even higher for women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, transgender individuals, and other members of vulnerable or underserved communities."

I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.  That's the choice I'll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.
Now that the campaign is over—what is the people's will? What is our mandate?  I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.
We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control.
The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season — a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.  This is the time to heal in America.

Today marks 22 years since Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime. Over two decades later, violence against LGBTQ+ Americans is at an all-time high. As president, I'll strengthen our hate crimes laws and make clear that bigotry has no place in America.

America has to be about the possibilities of prosperity.   Not just for the privileged few. But for the many — for all of us.
The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.  We can and must do better.  As president, I'll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay

When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.  When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.  When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.  It's unforgivable.

The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.   Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.   Let that sink in.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.  The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.  We're going to reward work — not wealth.

We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.    We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.  The stakes are too high.
