By mandating the federal recognition of same-sex marriages, the Respect for Marriage Act brings us closer to preserving the fundamental right of every American to marry who they love.

Thanks in part to the NDRC, states that were once gerrymandered by Republicans—Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Colorado, Minnesota—are now highly competitive. And thats how it should be—voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.
One reason the balance of power in the House of Representatives is so close is because, for the first time in a decade, there were enough competitive districts at play.

And I hope it provides a small measure of peace to the 9/11 families and everyone else who has suffered at the hands of al-Qaeda. "Its a tribute to President Bidens leadership, to the members of the intelligence community who have been working for decades for this moment, and to the counterterrorism professionals who were able to take al-Zawahiri out without a single civilian casualty.

For decades, Bill endured insults and vandalism, but never let it stop him from speaking up for whats right. I learned so much from the way he played, the way he coached, and the way he lived his life.  Michelle and I send our love to Bills family, and everyone who admired him.
Perhaps more than anyone else, Bill knew what it took to win and what it took to lead. On the court, he was the greatest champion in basketball history. Off of it, he was a civil rights trailblazer—marching with Dr. King and standing with Muhammad Ali.
Today, we lost a giant.  As tall as Bill Russell stood, his legacy rises far higher—both as a player and as a person.
Im grateful to President Biden and those in Congress – Democrat or Republican – who are working to deliver for the American people. Progress doesnt always happen all at once, but it does happen – and this is what it looks like.
Then President Biden and Democrats in Congress announced a deal that will fight inflation by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, cutting the deficit, and making the biggest investments in history to boost clean energy and tackle the climate crisis.
This has been a big week for the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress. First, Congress is on track to pass a bipartisan bill that will lower the cost of everything from cars to consumer goods, and make us less dependent on foreign semiconductors.

Thats why its more urgent now than ever before that Congress pass @POTUS climate and clean energy investments. The 6-3 decision strikes a blow to the EPAs authority to regulate power plant emissions—paving the way to dismantle some of the most impactful provisions of the Clean Air Act and limit our ability to reduce carbon pollution.

Today, the Supreme Court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, it relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues—attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.
Progress isnt always a straight line.  Todays Supreme Court decision is wrong but Congress passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a modest but real step forward. And the fight will go on, thanks to the activists, survivors, and families who continue to demand action.

And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies—not the ideal, but the reality. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.
The point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it. We will have to nurture it. We will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people.
In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories. For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is: How do we respond?
Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear, bigotry, and resentment have elevated leaders who, once theyre in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power.
On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, theyre targeting minority groups, theyre often flouting international law.

Its long past time for action, any kind of action. And its another tragedy—a quieter but no less tragic one—for families to wait another day.
Were also angry for them. Nearly ten years after Sandy Hook—and ten days after Buffalo—our country is paralyzed, not by fear, but by a gun lobby and a political party that have shown no willingness to act in any way that might help prevent these tragedies.
Michelle and I grieve with the families in Uvalde, who are experiencing pain no one should have to bear.

This weekends shootings in Buffalo offer a tragic reminder of the price we pay for refusing to curb the easy access to guns. It should also serve as a wakeup call for all Americans of goodwill, regardless of party.

Yesterday, I talked about how we should be able to agree on some basic facts – including around issues like climate change – and how companies need to be more careful about the content they promote, especially in ads. This is a good example of progress.  https://t.co/gNCvJlLnWK
When it comes to climate change,time really is running out. Earth Day is a reminder that if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, we can help preserve and protect our planet for future generations.
Its up to each of us to decide what we value, and to use the tools weve been given to advance those values. I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift – a government of, by, and for the people – for generations to come." Solving the disinformation problem wont cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world. But it can help rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make democracy stronger. "Each of us has to pick a side. Do we allow our democracy to wither? Or do we choose to make it better? Thats the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing.
As part of this, tech platforms need to recognize that they play a unique role in how people consume information, and their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society.   With that power comes accountability – and the need for some democratic oversight.
The way Im going to evaluate any proposal touching on social media and the internet is whether it strengthens or weakens the prospects for healthy, inclusive democracy. https://t.co/jmPMO28KMU

Through the @ObamaFoundation, were working to empower and equip emerging leaders to tackle issues like the spread of disinformation. https://t.co/e5T9rq4JUN
Part of the reason its hard to bring about change is because we live in a media environment that elevates falsehoods as much as truths, and divides people as much as it brings them together.

Progress often feels slow, and victories are sometimes incomplete. But the ACA shows that if you believe that we can improve peoples lives, and if youre willing to work through obstacles and continually improve, you can make America better.
But the ACA was never perfect, and we always knew we would have to make it better. Thats what @POTUS has done since taking office. Today, hes going even further – lowering premiums for nearly 1 million people and helping 200,000 more uninsured Americans get access to coverage.
The ACA also lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors, and allowed young people to stay on their parents plan. And its eliminated lifetime limits on benefits that often put people in a jam.
Because so many people made sacrifices and some members of Congress took courageous votes, we got the ACA across the finish line. Now, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage, and 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions cant be dropped or denied coverage.
Passing the ACA was incredibly difficult. People who had coverage were worried about losing it, the media was skeptical, misinformation was flying around, and Republicans showed no interest in working with us. But Joe, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and I were determined.
The Affordable Care Act is an example of why you run for office – not just to occupy a seat, but to make a difference in peoples lives.  Today Im joining @POTUS and @VP at the White House to celebrate everything the ACA has achieved, and help make it even better.

And every American who cares about the survival of our most cherished institutions should support the Presidents call as well. "The filibuster has no basis in the Constitution, and in recent years, it has become a routine way for the Senate minority to block important progress on issues supported by the majority of voters. But we cant allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy." Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to do the right thing and call a vote on crucial voting rights legislation. Future generations are counting on us to protect our democracy. I wrote out some thoughts about why this is so important. https://t.co/hjab4Ejxox "I wanted to share some of those stories, and also hear about the work youve been doing to create change: https://t.co/KhjWS3bFGo

Thats why, if were going to act on the scale thats required, climate change cant be seen as another opportunity to score political points. We need everybody. And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference.
But once again, progress is partial. Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be, and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized.
The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster, and are setting important goals for 2030. Theyve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change.

If we dont stand up for democracy, well see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states. Its why @DemRedistrict is fighting for #FairMaps. And its why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering.
And in Georgia, Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color – including African Americans in a historically Black district – and ignores how the state has changed.
In Texas, for example, Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder, especially for people of color. Now theyre advancing a new congressional map thats tilted in their favor and doesnt reflect the states growth. https://t.co/VRvoLXZsPq
Right now, state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts. And in many states, Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power.

Now we need to keep it up. Because until every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, we have more work to do—and Im grateful to President Biden for continuing to lead the fight.
The American Rescue Plan lowers premiums for millions of families, makes health insurance more affordable for low-and middle-income Americans, and provides incentives for states to expand Medicaid and cover as many as four million additional Americans.
And now, thanks to the hard work of President Biden, Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Americans all across the country who have spent years fighting against repeal and pushing to improve the law, our starter home is starting to look pretty spacious." But Ive always said that the ACA is like a starter home—its our job to keep tinkering with it and improving it over time. The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage—and up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans who've lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic.

And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.  https://t.co/ftmm5crbgg
Second, a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change in a community like Ferguson with a history of blatant discriminatory law enforcement practices.  https://t.co/U0z9wMOx8z
Heres a useful read––a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.  https://t.co/Ondw85gQNL
""Lets do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice dont matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who youre voting for. And thats how we're going to hit 'em."" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2" Lets get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv "I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts.
If you want to take concrete action, but youre not sure how, weve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations whove been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I
5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away.
4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isnt between protest and politics––we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.
3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.
2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices." 1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support. "Ultimately, its going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:
As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, Ive heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change." I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv My statement on the death of George Floyd: https://t.co/Hg1k9JHT6R "If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Heres a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election: https://t.co/FmN8RCJymg https://t.co/R5FZ6OBfxz
On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but its even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19.  The way they lived, in service to one another, should be our roadmap in the months ahead. https://t.co/S0sqvuicm8
And heres more on the approach Sweden has taken, which differs from some of its neighbors:   https://t.co/Qw5R0O5RhM

The Class of 2020 is full of the leaders we need to bend the arc of history toward a better future—and our HBCU grads have the talent, skills, and vision to lead that change. I couldn't be prouder of all of you. https://t.co/Qlr5ivBvpJ
As Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. Its one of the things I love most about the city—and one of the many reasons its such a good home for the @ObamaFoundation. https://t.co/ALo7kusc8K

Graduating is a big achievement no matter what, but with all that the Class of 2020 has dealt with to get across the finish line, I think theyve earned a little celebration. I hope youll all join me in honoring them at 2PM ET and 8PM ET. https://t.co/dBK5nll7w8" Vote. "Michelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so were reading The Word Collector for @chipublib.

Despite all the time thats been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now. https://t.co/pfokyI8GiB
Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, were already creating something better for tomorrow. https://t.co/9ScwPruoyA
Even if you cant give the moms in your life a hug today, I hope you can give them an extra thank you today. Thank you and Happy Mothers Day to the woman who makes it all possible. Love you, @michelleobama. https://t.co/E9ebxaSBpy
Theres no limit to the devotion Ive seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldnt be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. https://t.co/xYECcrAxdE
Ive always loved joining commencements––the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we cant get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. https://t.co/ngR2ykx3A2
The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository—and food banks in communities like yours—are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families whove fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. https://t.co/kSdijlyHLH
The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze
In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. https://t.co/JkaBWYejKh" This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; theyre helping us build a more equitable future for all. https://t.co/9dsedZYt0E "If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. Its not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQR
While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vU
We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. https://t.co/uNueQl5bNX

Let's go: https://t.co/maHVGRozkX "Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship—as they are Americans in every way but on paper. https://t.co/e4IYqX3WIy
We can't deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It's a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions. https://t.co/aipc8p7Hwh
Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope––a reminder of rebirth and renewal––and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. https://t.co/xEsgxOarQ5" Lets not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. https://t.co/aTNxRV4Ws3 "Everyone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. https://t.co/gL38DpYEmu" No one should be forced to choose between their right to vote and their right to stay healthy like the debacle in Wisconsin this week. https://t.co/fbDCbOb9qN "Some good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. Its critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. https://t.co/56RgGeAfr7
Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and theyll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work. https://t.co/YzqPMPo8m2
Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people––and all of humanity––of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually.
Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring – something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReB
My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone Ive turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world. https://t.co/6bQski6N23
Its World Health Day, and we owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our medical professionals. Theyre still giving their all for us every day, at great risk to themselves, and we cant thank them enough for their bravery and their service.
Bill Withers was a true American master. His music, rooted in the everyday joys and sorrows of working people, was soulful, wise and life-affirming––a perfect tonic for hard times. https://t.co/P8cusIny4k
As she often does, @SenWarren provides a cogent summary of how federal policymakers should be thinking about the pandemic in the coming months. https://t.co/zkX0E7ncK5
It's Census Day and we all have a crucial role to play. Filling out the 2020 Census determines what the next decade will look like for your community: your roads, health care, schools, representation and more. Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. https://t.co/KzxFJKavmM
We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. https://t.co/K8Ucu7iVDK
So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. https://t.co/K8Pvp9Cyaq" We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started—that journey to justice. "What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, We aint going back. Weve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.
Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/xxjY2habOm
During this crisis, our grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, transit and utility workers—along with so many others—have been selflessly getting up every day to make sure we have the things we need. And for that, we say thank you. https://t.co/Fq5qIRXt03
And this article provides a great example of the kind of community spirit that we need to get through this—a spirit that we can hopefully learn to instill more of into our lives, workplaces, civic institutions, and government once the crisis has passed. https://t.co/xYZvspW4Ug" Heres a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. https://t.co/uYpP1KfOUs These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake—for theirs. https://t.co/bwNXhOPMYs Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one.

It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. https://t.co/zz2v3DzMgq" Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid.

As communities have begun to recognize the importance of social distancing measures to flatten the curve on COVID-19 transmission, heres a sober but useful primer on what we should expect in the coming months: https://t.co/9oqdRF5J0Q" We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody wholl be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while. Theyre giving everything. May we all model our own behavior on their selflessness and sacrifice as we help each other through this. https://t.co/F3tsJTqd4c "Not everybody can stay home, and we owe a big debt of gratitude to health professionals, transit and airport workers, first responders, and everyone keeping our communities going.
