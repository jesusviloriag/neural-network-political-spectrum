The Legislature approved a $25 million Hurricane Michael grant program for assisting with the recovery in NW Florida.   Michael was a catastrophic storm and while great progress has been made, this is a long-term effort. I ask that you re-up this grant program for another year.
Hurricane recovery has been a priority for my administration.

All Florida parents, regardless of income or zip code, should have the ability to choose the best school for their children.
Last year, we had nearly 13,000 low-income families on the waiting list for a tax credit scholarship. Thanks to the enactment of the new Family Empowerment scholarship, these families have been liberated from the waiting list.

Low taxes and a healthy business climate are important in attracting investment in Florida, but so too is our ability to produce top-flight talent – through our colleges and universities, through workforce education opportunities and through strong K-12 schools.
We have strong momentum and need to keep it going. We have a chance to take bold action to make a lasting positive impact upon Florida’s environment.    Let’s seize this opportunity.
This vision required a commitment from the Legislature, and you delivered – to the tune of more than $625 million for water resources and Everglades projects.
When I took office, I issued a sweeping executive order outlining a bold approach to protecting our natural resources, improving water quality and restoring the Everglades.
Florida must remain steadfast in its commitment to low taxes and fiscal responsibility. Maintaining fiscal health will provide the type of durable foundation required for the expansion of our economic base, which means more opportunities for the people of Florida.
While we should look with favor on these bold beginnings, we have much more to do.
In 2019, we took bold steps to expand educational opportunities, protect our environment and natural resources, reform health care, invest in infrastructure and bolster public safety – all while reducing taxes and adding to our budget reserves."

RT @CaseyDeSantis : Thank you to our state’s foster families, state employees, community partners, volunteers and judges who work tirelessly to help our most vulnerable find loving, forever homes.
RT @CaseyDeSantis : On National Adoption Day, courts and communities come together to finalize thousands of adoptions. @MyFLFamilies Secretary Chad Poppell and I had the great honor of congratulating some of those families today.
This budget places an emphasis where it is needed, making key investments in our K-12 education system, our environment and the well-being of all Florida families. Florida’s future has never been bolder, brighter or better than it is today.
As part of my recommended budget for election integrity, we included $1.4 million for Florida to join the Election Information Registration Center (ERIC).
Ensuring free and fair elections is crucial in preserving our democracy. That is why the budget recommends $6.6 million for state-level election oversight activities, with a focus on cybersecurity enhancements to Florida’s election system." .@FDLEpio is responsible for maintaining a variety of databases that law enforcement use to investigate crimes and apprehend criminals. The budget includes more than $14.5 million to expand and enhance these databases. "Earlier this year I directed @fdlepio to develop a statewide threat assessment strategy. In my budget, I am proud to include $4.7 million and 20 positions to implement the first Statewide Behavioral Threat Assessment strategy in the country.
Through the Hurricane Michael Recovery Grant Program, my budget includes $25 million for resources where insufficient federal, private, and insurance funds are available to fund projects designed to repair, replace, and hardening of affected infrastructure." Hurricane recovery has been a top priority for my administration. The State of Florida is projected to spend over $1.9 billion on hurricane preparedness and recovery for the two most recent hurricanes to make landfall in Florida – Irma and Michael. "The budget also provides $8.8 billion for the State Transportation Work Program, including $2.8 billion for highway construction, $323.9 million for aviation improvements and $212.9 million for safety initiatives.
Despite our strong economy and low unemployment, finding affordable housing can be challenging. My budget provides $387 million to fully fund Workplace and Affordable Housing Programs, with $267.2 million for the SHIP and $119.8 million for the SAIL program.
As we continue to work towards making Florida the most veteran-friendly state in the nation, my budget provides $27 million for Florida’s military presence and families, which will continue to fund military research and development.
The well-being of our children is paramount, which is why we invest $97.6 million to fund services to children and families who rely on Florida’s child welfare system. This includes $75.7 million for improving and enhancing quality within the current system.
My proposed budget also includes more than $17 million in new mental health and substance abuse funding, as well as an additional $25 million - for a total of $100 million - for mental health initiatives in Florida’s schools." We are determined to find meaningful solutions to the substance abuse and mental health challenges facing our state. My budget recommends over $54 million to continue the fight against opioid abuse in Florida. "This more than $625 million investment includes over $322 million for Everglades restoration projects, $150 million for water quality improvements, $50 million for springs restoration and more than $22 million to combat the harmful effects of algal blooms and red tide.
The budget continues our important focus on the environment, recommending more than $625 million in recurring funding for Everglades restoration and the protection of our vital water resources, moving us closer to our goal of investing $2.5 billion over four years.
To further stimulate Florida’s workforce, the budget includes $10 million to expand or establish apprenticeship programs through the Pathways to Career Opportunities Grant Program that we created last legislative session.
In addition to this minimum salary increase, I’m proposing $300 million to implement the Florida Classroom Teacher Bonus and Florida School Principal Bonus programs to reward our high-performing educators.
2020 will be the year of the teacher in Florida. I’m recommending raising the minimum salary for full-time classroom teachers to $47,500. This $600 million investment would provide a pay raise for more than 101,000 teachers across Florida.
I believe that all students in Florida should have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education. In K-12 public schools, my budget proposes an increase in per student funding of $7,979, or $302 per student.
To relieve Floridians’ tax burden, my budget proposes over $312 million in tax relief. This includes a $56 million 8-day Back-to-School Sales Tax Holiday, a $9 million 10-day Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday and property tax relief of $247.3 million.
Today, I am pleased to announce my budget recommendation for Fiscal Year 2020-2021. The Bolder, Brighter, Better Future budget of $91.4 billion represents a decrease in per capita spending and an increase in our state reserves.
